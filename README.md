漂亮的编辑!现在您已经有了一个分支的更改，您可以打开一个pull请求。

Nice edits! Now that you have changes in a branch off of master, you can open a pull request.
Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

拉请求是GitHub合作的核心。当你打开一个pull请求时，你在提出你的改变，并要求某人回顾并拉入你的贡献，并将它们合并到他们的分支中。拉请求显示来自两个分支的内容的差异或差异。更改、添加和减法显示在绿色和红色中。

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

一旦您做出了提交，您就可以打开pull请求并开始讨论，甚至在代码完成之前

By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.

通过使用GitHub的@提到系统在你的拉请求信息中，你可以询问来自特定的人或团队的反馈，不管他们是在大厅还是10个时区之外。

You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub Flow before working on larger projects.

您甚至可以在自己的存储库中打开pull请求并自己合并它们。在进行大型项目之前，这是学习GitHub流程的好方法
